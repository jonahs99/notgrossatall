In-browser, fully multiplayer capture-the-flag built on node.js and websockets. Online now with 500+ players/day.

## Features

* No framework or game engine - just straight js with socket.io
* Intuitive mouse-only control
* Authoritative server model with client-side interpolation
* Support for 32 concurrent players
* All graphics are HTML5 canvas primitives
* Particle system (see screenshot)
* Numerous power ups
* "Spectator mode" follows players before you join the game
* A barely-functioning [map editor](http://tanqs.io/map.html)
* Mobile interface in progress

### Note: I am working on a complete rewrite as I have botched in too many features into this prototype.
